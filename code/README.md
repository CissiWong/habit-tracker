# Technigo React Starter App

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.

Add components in the `src` folder and use them in `src/app.js` to get started.

## Usage

1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
1. Start the project: `npm start`
