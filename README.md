### Tech Specifications

The project should be built in React. It should also be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet and desktop. Your code should conform to the Technigo eslint rules, too.

The code folder in this repository contains a copy of the Technigo React Starter project. You should use this as a base for your project.

# :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the main task? Try to come up with some fun stretch goals within your company. Here's some ideas:

1. Build some sort of statistics page which shows how many tasks have been completed per week, or renders some charts
1. Package the app as a Chrome extension, or make it run as an electron app (Damien can help you with this!)
